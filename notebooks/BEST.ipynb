    "\n",
    "This model replicates the example used in **Bayesian estimation supersedes the t-test** {cite:p}`kruschke2013`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several statistical inference procedures involve the comparison of two groups. We may be interested in whether one group is larger than another, or simply different from the other. We require a statistical model for this because true differences are usually accompanied by measurement or stochastic noise that prevent us from drawing conclusions simply from differences calculated from the observed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *de facto* standard for statistically comparing two (or more) samples is to use a statistical test. This involves expressing a null hypothesis, which typically claims that there is no difference between the groups, and using a chosen test statistic to determine whether the distribution of the observed data is plausible under the hypothesis. This rejection occurs when the calculated test statistic is higher than some pre-specified threshold value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it is not easy to conduct hypothesis tests correctly, and their results are very easy to misinterpret. Setting up a statistical test involves several subjective choices (*e.g.* statistical test to use, null hypothesis to test, significance level) by the user that are rarely justified based on the problem or decision at hand, but rather, are usually based on traditional choices that are entirely arbitrary {cite:p}`johnson1999`. The evidence that it provides to the user is indirect, incomplete, and typically overstates the evidence against the null hypothesis {cite:p}`goodman1999`. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more informative and effective approach for comparing groups is one based on **estimation** rather than **testing**, and is driven by Bayesian probability rather than frequentist. That is, rather than testing whether two groups are different, we instead pursue an estimate of how different they are, which is fundamentally more informative. Moreover, we include an estimate of uncertainty associated with that difference which includes uncertainty due to our lack of knowledge of the model parameters (epistemic uncertainty) and uncertainty due to the inherent stochasticity of the system (aleatory uncertainty)."

    "The first step in a Bayesian approach to inference is to specify the full probability model that corresponds to the problem. For this example, Kruschke chooses a Student-t distribution to describe the distributions of the scores in each group. This choice adds robustness to the analysis, as a T distribution is less sensitive to outlier observations, relative to a normal distribution. The three-parameter Student-t distribution allows for the specification of a mean $\\mu$, a precision (inverse-variance) $\\lambda$ and a degrees-of-freedom parameter $\\nu$:\n",

    "           \n",
    "The degrees-of-freedom parameter essentially specifies the \"normality\" of the data, since larger values of $\\nu$ make the distribution converge to a normal distribution, while small values (close to zero) result in heavier tails. Thus, the likelihood functions of our model are specified as follows:\n",

    "$$y^{(treat)}_i \\sim T(\\nu, \\mu_1, \\sigma_1)$$\n",

    "$$y^{(placebo)}_i \\sim T(\\nu, \\mu_2, \\sigma_2)$$\n",

We will, of course, have separate parameters for the means $\\mu_k, k=1,2$ and standard deviations $\\sigma_k$. Since the means are real-valued, we will apply normal priors on them, and arbitrarily set the hyperparameters to the pooled empirical mean of the data and twice the pooled empirical standard deviation, which applies very diffuse information to these quantities (and importantly, does not favor one or the other *a priori*).\n",

This is a poor choice of prior, because very basic prior knowledge about measures of human coginition dictate that the variation cannot ever be as high as this upper bound. IQ is a standardized measure, and hence this constrains how variable a given population's IQ values can be. When you place such a wide uniform prior on these values, you are essentially giving a lot of prior weight on inadmissable values. In this example, there is little practical difference, but in general it is best to apply as much prior information that you have available to the parameterization of prior distributions. \n",
