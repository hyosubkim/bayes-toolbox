# Future Plans

**Are there any plans to further develop BST?**  

Yes, in terms of models there will be much more coming soon! I plan to add the following in the near future:

- Bayes Factors
- Bayesian meta-analysis 
- Bayesian spectral analysis
- Model selection
- Incorporating prior and posterior predictive checks into all of the examples (currently, only logistic regression notebook has example of prior predictive check)
- Incorporating maximum entropy priors 


Also, once we receive more feedback on BST and iron out some kinks, we will add BST to the Python Package Index (PyPI) to make finding and installing BST much easier. 

If you use BST and/or have suggestions, please check out the How to Contribute page.
