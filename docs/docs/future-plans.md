# Future Plans

**Are there any plans to further develop bayes-toolbox?**  

Yes, in terms of models there will be much more coming soon! I plan to add the following in the near future:

- Bayes Factors
- Bayesian meta-analysis 
- Bayesian spectral analysis
- Model selection
- Incorporating prior and posterior predictive checks into all of the examples (currently, only logistic regression notebook has example of prior predictive check)
- Incorporating maximum entropy priors
