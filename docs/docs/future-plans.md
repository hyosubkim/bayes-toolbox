# Future Plans

**Are there any plans to further develop bayes-toolbox?**  

Yes, `bayes-toolbox` is in continuous development. The following are planned for the near future:

- More Bayesian meta-analyses 
- Bayesian spectral analysis
- Model selection
- Incorporating prior and posterior predictive checks into examples (logistic regression notebook has example of prior predictive check)
- Incorporating maximum entropy priors
