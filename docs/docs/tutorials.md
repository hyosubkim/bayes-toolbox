# bayes-toolbox tutorials

***Update: Hyosub's recorded [PyMCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElfToZ9EBpM) is now up on YouTube. You can find links to the talk and the tutorial notebook [here](https://discourse.pymc.io/t/pymcon-web-series-05-the-bayesian-statistics-toolbox-april-17th-2023-hyosub-kim/11845). A Jupyter version of the tutorial is also available in the [`examples`](https://github.com/hyosubkim/bayes-toolbox/tree/main/examples) directory of the bayes-toolbox repository.***

The [examples](https://github.com/hyosubkim/bayes-toolbox/tree/main/examples) page has many other great examples of using `bayes-toolbox`.

Much of the data and images are from the website for John K. Kruschke's textbook [Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/). The notebooks are a combination of adaptations of Jordi Warmenhoven's excellent [PyMC3 port of the textbook](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/DBDA-python), edited materials put out by the PyMC developers, and original material. They are meant as example use cases that show you how to use `bayes-toolbox` and take advantage of some of the new functionality afforded since the release of [PyMC 4.0](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) with ArviZ.
