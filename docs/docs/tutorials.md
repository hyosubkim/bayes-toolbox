# Bayesian Statistics Toolbox (BST) example notebooks

Check out [this page](https://github.com/hyosubkim/bayesian-statistics-toolbox/tree/main/examples) for examples of using BST.

All of the data and images are from the website for John K. Kruschke's textbook [Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/).  

These notebooks are adaptations of Jordi Warmenhoven's excellent [PyMC3 port of the textbook](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/DBDA-python) as well as one from the PyMC developers. They are meant as example use cases that show you how to use BST and take advantage of some of the new functionality afforded by [PyMC 4.0](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) in combination with ArviZ.   

More complete examples to come soon!
