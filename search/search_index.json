The package is actively being developed in a public GitHub repository . Why is this useful? Research bayes-toolbox provides you with the tools for utilizing and exploring Bayesian statistics in your own research projects right away. By wrapping model definitions of Bayesian generalized linear models into convenient functions, bayes-toolbox makes it easy to run Bayesian analyses that are analogous to some of the most commonly used frequentist tests in the behavioral and neural sciences (think t-tests, ANOVAs, regression). All of the models (tests) are executable with one-liners, thereby making them ideal for use in an open, replicable (and Bayesian) workflow. Example use cases and tests for nearly every model are provided in the examples directory, so you can see what a sensible Bayesian data analysis pipeline looks like. Many of the example notebooks are adaptations of Jordi Warmenhoven's Python/PyMC3 port of John Kruschke's excellent textbook \"Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan (DBDA)\" . The benefits of using bayes-toolbox in terms of time and convenience will be most noticeable when utilizing hierarchical (multi-level) models, including the ANOVA-like ones. This is because bayes-toolbox takes care of the more finicky steps involved in Bayesian statistical modeling with embedded functions for things like standardizing/unstandardizing variables for more efficient MCMC sampling, parsing categorical variables for easier indexing, and implementing sum-to-zero constraints in ANOVA-like models. These are the sorts of implementational details that can add time (and frustration) when creating an analysis pipeline and discourage otherwise interested scientists from using Bayesian statistics. bayes-toolbox now removes those obstacles. Please note that the models in bayes-toolbox all utilize fairly uninformative, diffuse priors, which are, for the most part, the exact same ones used in the Kruschke text. Education bayes-toolbox is also useful if you're going through the DBDA textbook and want to see how to implement many of the models in Python/PyMC.

Getting Started Tutorials Future Plans How to Contribute Bayesian models that are currently included and validated (frequentist analogue in parentheses) Comparison of two groups (independent samples t-test) Comparison of single or paired samples (paired t-test) Simple linear regression Multiple regression Multi-level (hierarchical) linear regression for modeling group- and individual-specific parameters Hierarchical (multi-level) model of metric outcome with single categorical predictor (one-way ANOVA) Hierarchical (multi-level) model of metric outcome with single categorical and single metric predictors (ANCOVA) Hierarchical (multi-level) model of metric outcome with two categorical predictors (two-way ANOVA) Hierarchical (multi-level) model of metric outcome with multiple categorical predictors and repeated measures (mixed-model ANOVA) Logistic regression models incorporating categorical or metric predictors Meta-analysis of binary outcomes using random effects model Other related Python projects For a more weapons-grade Bayesian statistical modeling interface, check out: Bambi : BAyesian Model-Building Interface (BAMBI) in Python. In contrast to Bambi , bayes-toolbox does not require any model formulas, and instead only requires calling the function associated with a particular test. This difference in approach likely stems from the origins of this package as a tool for running the models in the Kruschke text in as quick and painless a manner as possible.

Installation Recommended (pip) We recommend installing the latest stable version of bayes_toolbox with pip (from the Terminal): pip install bayes_toolbox From source: Cloning and building The latest development version of bayes-toolbox can be cloned from GitHub using git : git clone git://github.com/hyosubkim/bayes-toolbox.git To build and install the project (from the root directory, i.e., inside the cloned bayes-toolbox directory): python3 -m pip install -e . Dependencies bayes_toolbox has the following dependencies (all of which should be automatically imported with a pip installation): - aesara - arviz - numpy - pandas - pymc Virtual environment You can create a virtual environment with all of the necessary dependencies. If you've cloned the bayes-toolbox repository, make sure you're in the root directory of the cloned repository (i.e., bayes-toolbox ) and type the following conda command in the Terminal ( Anaconda is strongly recommended for installing Python and the conda utility on your computer): conda env create --name bayes_toolbox --file environment.yml Instead of bayes_toolbox , you may wish to give your environment a different name. If you're not using MacOSX and want to replicate this environment, read the \"Export your environment\" section of this page . After cloning and installing bayes-toolbox locally, you can access it from any directory. Helpful hints If you've created the bayes_toolbox virtual environment and want to access the correct kernel from a Jupyter notebook, you must manually add the kernel for your new virtual environment \"bayes_toolbox\" (or whatever you named it). To do so, you first need to install ipykernel : pip install --user ipykernel Next, add your virtual environment to Jupyter: python -m ipykernel install --user --name=MYENV Use whatever you named your virtual environment in place of MYENV . That should be all that's necessary in order to choose your new virtual environment as a kernel from your Jupyter notebook. For more details, read this page . How do I learn to use BST? The BEST notebook (short for \"Bayesian Estimation Supersedes the t-Test\", a famous 2013 article by John Kruschke) in the examples directory is a good place to see how bayes-toolbox can be used to make implementing Bayesian analyses easy. I've adapted the notebook of the same name from the PyMC developers to show how the model building and MCMC sampling are all embedded in a single function now. You can see similar workflows for other model types in all of the other example notebooks, which track several of the chapters from \"Doing Bayesian Data Analysis\" and is modeled off of Jordi Warmenhoven's repo . Example syntax Now, if you want to run a fairly sophisticated multi-level (hierarchical) linear regression model in which you are modeling individual as well as group-level slope and intercept parameters, it looks like this: # Import the bayes-toolbox package import bayes_toolbox.glm as bg # Call your bayes-toolbox function and return the PyMC model and InferenceData objects model, idata = bg.hierarchical_regression(df[\"x\"], df[\"y\"], df[\"subj\"]) Before, this would have taken many more lines of code: # Standardize variables zx, mu_x, sigma_x = standardize(x) zy, mu_y, sigma_y = standardize(y) # Convert subject variable to categorical dtype if it is not already subj_idx, subj_levels, n_subj = parse_categorical(subj) # Define your statistical model with pm.Model(coords={\"subj\": subj_levels}) as model: # Hyperpriors zbeta0 = pm.Normal(\"zbeta0\", mu=0, tau=1 / 10**2) zbeta1 = pm.Normal(\"zbeta1\", mu=0, tau=1 / 10**2) zsigma0 = pm.Uniform(\"zsigma0\", 10**-3, 10**3) zsigma1 = pm.Uniform(\"zsigma1\", 10**-3, 10**3) # Priors for individual subject parameters zbeta0_s_offset = pm.Normal(\"zbeta0_s_offset\", mu=0, sigma=1, dims=\"subj\") zbeta0_s = pm.Deterministic( \"zbeta0_s\", zbeta0 + zbeta0_s_offset * zsigma0, dims=\"subj\" ) zbeta1_s_offset = pm.Normal(\"zbeta1_s_offset\", mu=0, sigma=1, dims=\"subj\") zbeta1_s = pm.Deterministic( \"zbeta1_s\", zbeta1 + zbeta1_s_offset * zsigma1, dims=\"subj\" ) mu = zbeta0_s[subj_idx] + zbeta1_s[subj_idx] * zx zsigma = pm.Uniform(\"zsigma\", 10**-3, 10**3) nu_minus_one = pm.Exponential(\"nu_minus_one\", 1 / 29) nu = pm.Deterministic(\"nu\", nu_minus_one + 1) # Define likelihood function likelihood = pm.StudentT(\"likelihood\", nu, mu=mu, sigma=zsigma, observed=zy) # Sample from posterior idata = pm.sample(draws=n_draws, target_accept=acceptance_rate)","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/#how-do-i-get-started","text":"","title":"How do I get started?"},{"location":"getting-started/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"getting-started/#recommended-pip","text":"We recommend installing the latest stable version of bayes_toolbox with pip (from the Terminal): pip install bayes_toolbox","title":"Recommended (pip)"},{"location":"getting-started/#from-source-cloning-and-building","text":"The latest development version of bayes-toolbox can be cloned from GitHub using git : git clone git://github.com/hyosubkim/bayes-toolbox.git To build and install the project (from the root directory, i.e., inside the cloned bayes-toolbox directory): python3 -m pip install -e .","title":"From source: Cloning and building"},{"location":"getting-started/#dependencies","text":"bayes_toolbox has the following dependencies (all of which should be automatically imported with a pip installation): - aesara - arviz - numpy - pandas - pymc","title":"Dependencies"},{"location":"getting-started/#virtual-environment","text":"You can create a virtual environment with all of the necessary dependencies.
